small script to fix exported anime lists in mal format from other providers (like hummingbirds) using tools like https://forums.hummingbird.me/t/dawn-myanimelist-compatible-library-exporter/16586

it uses your mal dump if you had it to insert the scores you had and your user info in said dump to maintain scores you already had in mal.
